<h1> explaination of the html code </h1>
This code represents a simple HTML document that creates a webpage displaying colored markers using CSS. Let's break down the different parts of the code:

<!DOCTYPE html>: This declaration defines the document type and version of HTML being used. In this case, it's HTML5.

<html lang="en">: The root element of the HTML document, indicating that the document is written in English (en stands for English).

<head>: This section contains metadata about the HTML document, such as character encoding, viewport settings, title, and external stylesheets.

<meta charset="utf-8">: Specifies the character encoding for the document as UTF-8, which is a widely used character encoding that supports various languages.

<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">: Sets the viewport settings for responsive design. It ensures that the page adapts to the device width and starts with an initial zoom scale of 1.0.

<title>Colored Markers</title>: Sets the title of the HTML document, which typically appears in the browser's title bar or tab.

<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">: Links an external CSS stylesheet named "styles.css" to the HTML document. This stylesheet likely contains the styling rules for the colored markers.

<body>: This section contains the content of the HTML document that will be displayed in the browser.

<h1>CSS Color Markers</h1>: Defines a level 1 heading with the text "CSS Color Markers."

<div class="container">: A container div that holds the colored markers.

<div class="marker red">: A div representing a red-colored marker. It consists of two child divs: one for the cap (<div class="cap"></div>) and one for the sleeve (<div class="sleeve"></div>).

<div class="marker green">: Similar to the red marker, but green.

<div class="marker blue">: Similar to the red and green markers, but blue.
