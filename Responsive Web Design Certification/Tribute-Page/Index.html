                Mahatma Gandhi, born on October 2, 1869, in Porbandar, India, was a leader of the Indian independence
                movement against British rule. He is also known as the "Father of the Nation" in India. Gandhi's
                philosophy of nonviolent resistance played a crucial role in India's struggle for freedom.
                His commitment to peace, justice, and equality inspired millions worldwide. Through acts of civil
                disobedience, such as the famous Salt March in 1930, he led the Indian people in challenging oppressive
                British policies.
                Gandhi's teachings continue to resonate globally, advocating for truth, tolerance, and the power of
                nonviolence in achieving social and political change.
